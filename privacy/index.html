                Legal basis of processing
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
                <ul>
                    <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal 
                        Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. 
                        This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                    <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
                    <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision 
                of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
            </p>

                safeguard their Data.
                If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the

        Your California privacy rights and how to exercise them
        The right to know and to portability
        You have the right to request that we disclose to you:

        the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your information and with whom such information is shared;
        in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where we disclose:
        for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient; and
        for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient.
        The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.

        If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance – provided that this is technically feasible.

        The right to request the deletion of your personal information
        You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Website, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).

        If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.

        How to exercise your rights
        To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.

        For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:

        provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
        describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.

        If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.

        If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.

        You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.

        How and when we are expected to handle your request
        We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.

        We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.

        Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.

        Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.

        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
