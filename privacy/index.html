                Legal basis of processing
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal 
                    Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. 
                    This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
                <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision 
                of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Place

                Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about 
                the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
                Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization 
                governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to 
                safeguard their Data.
                If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the 
                information provided in the contact section.

                    or by contacting the Owner.</li>
                <li>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as

                    so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</li>
                <li>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
